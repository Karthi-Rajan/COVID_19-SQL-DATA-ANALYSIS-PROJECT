🦠 COVID-19 SQL Data Exploration Project
📊 Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic using structured query language (SQL). The dataset includes information on COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations from March 2020 to June 2021.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights and trends regarding the pandemic's spread, mortality, and vaccination progress using SQL — from basic queries to advanced analytical functions.
